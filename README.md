# Projects

Hi, my name is FÃ©lix Fautsch, I am an information systems and management student with a passion for everything **computer vision** and **machine learning**. In this repository I want to share some of my most notable projects with the world. The repository is divided into seperate directories, all containing a singular project. The structure is the following:

- [Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)](https://github.com/fylexx/Projects/blob/main/PredictiveMeanMatching/predictivemeanmatching.ipynb): This notebook contains a simple visual explanation of PMM. It showcases the power PMM has for imputing data where the distribution plays a critical role. It compares a 'standard' linear mean imputation with PMM. The results clearly show that for certain data (ex.: polynomial distributed data) PMM manages to maintain the variability within the data.
